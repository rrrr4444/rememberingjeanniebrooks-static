                <p>
                  Dear Katharine, I‚Äôm so very sorry to hear about Jeannie‚Äôs passing. I consider her (and you) one of my
                  oldest friends from home and have so many amazing memories that we all made together during the
                  earliest years.
                  We had so much fun back then - thru thick and thin - and I will always remember laughing a lot w/
                  Jeannie and you as well. It‚Äôs hard to think of the old Larchmont ‚Äòhood w/out thinking of the Collotons
                  - your family had quite the presence there.
                  I remember one of the first times I met Jeannie, she had come our home one Saturday morning to share
                  what she had consumed for breakfast. She proceeded to tell my parents that she has just eaten four
                  eggs and 2 pieces of toast. She was about 4 or 5
                  years old at that time. It was a blow to me though because I refused to eat any eggs (hated them!) and
                  I remember my Dad telling me that she was a ‚Äúbig girl‚Äù for cleaning her plate and eating well. I was a
                  terrible eater and this little kid came into my
                  kitchen and put me to shame! Lol üòÇ I think there was a bit of an exaggeration going on but Jeannie‚Äôs
                  ability to embellish was always very impressive to those listening to her great story telling - even
                  from a young age!
                </p>
                <p>
                  Then there was all the great summer time fun we had at Orienta in the early years and then working at
                  Beach Point w/ you, Jeannie, Meg and Carole. I don‚Äôt think I can ever be in that section of Mam‚Äôk and
                  not think
                  of the fun and games we played back then. It wasn‚Äôt work - it was fun... and Jeannie and I were the
                  ice cream girls. I remember when we drove to PA to visit you at Rosemont college for the weekend.
                  Yikes! We had such a
                  great ride down and back - I think that was the best part of that trip. Jeannie was so easy to talk
                  with and we never ran out of subject matter to discuss. We laughed so much about everything - we
                  shared so many memories
                  growing up. And all the mischief making we got into (creative minds that needed an outlet is how I
                  prefer to classify it today!) was epic and drove our collective parents absolutely nuts. We were
                  young, wild and free.
                  Maybe a bit dangerous but still harmless. I only wish I had a chance to see Jeannie again and catch up
                  on all those great memories. I‚Äôm very sad to hear that she is gone.... I can only imagine she was the
                  best kind of mother to her twin girls.
                  She had such a maternal instinct from a very young age. She truly adored kids and babysitting all the
                  little ones. Some people are natural mothers - I have no doubt that‚Äôs what Jeannie was to her kids.
                  Again, I‚Äôm so very sorry for your loss.
                  I know how much you loved Jeannie and how close you two always were.
                  You were a great big sister to her and you always looked out for her well being and took such great
                  pride in being her sister. That‚Äôs what I remember most about the two of you - the bond was always very
                  tight and the love was strong..
                  I wish I had some photos to post but I was never big on taking pictures growing up. The memories are
                  still very fresh in my mind though. Please give my condolences and deepest sympathies to Edmund and
                  Andrew too.

                <p>I met Jeannie the summer of 2012 when I photographed Kayla and Madeline for their senior portraits
                  and the Brooks family for a holiday card. In 201, I took photographs of Randall and Jeannie together.
                  Special moments, all of them!</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>My most treasured memories of Jeannie center on our wonderful walks and talks on Main Street. I feel

                <p>Jeannie has always been a live-wire! And the love that she shared throughout her life was well
                  represented in the Memorial Service today. I only wish I could have known her better as an adult.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>One memory that is likely unique to me is very special...and a predictor of Jeannie&#39;s outgoing
                  love of life for the rest of her life! When Jeannie was about three years old, her Uncle Bill Colloton
                  and I came to New York for a visit. We lived in California and thought it would be fun to bring the
                  kids gifts that we purchased in Mexico. I really don&#39;t remember what we gave the others, but
                  Jeannie received a Mexican style little dress, complete with ruffles. It happened to be white, and she
                  immediately declared that it was her wedding dress! (See, Randall, even then she was preparing to be
                  your Mrs.!)</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>I loved Jeannie&#39;s delight in her girls -- she was faithful to send me pictures every Christmas
                  and there was a mother&#39;s love always present.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>Thank you for including Cliff and me in this lovely celebration of Jeannie&#39;s life. She will
                  surely be missed by so many. I am delighted to know that, because we share faith in Jesus Christ, I
                  will get to share a hug with her once again!!</p>

              <div class="card-text my-2 p-2 text-dark">
                <p>The first time I met and conversed with Jeannie Brooks, I came away from that encounter thinking
                  ‚ÄúThis is One Classy Lady‚Äù. Every subsequent interaction only served to allow this observation to
                  strengthen and grow.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>The definition of ‚Äúclassy‚Äù is somewhat elusive. I once asked an older man, a man whose wisdom o
                  sometimes seek, how to describe ‚Äúclassy‚Äù. His response was ‚ÄúIt is not something easily described, yet
                  you will know it when you see it‚Äù. Question answered.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>The years that I have known Jeannie, she has worked in the real estate profession. This is a business
                  known for strife, jealousy, posturing, ego and less than fully transparent dealings. Based on my
                  observations, Jeannie NEVER let any of these factors interfere with her helping her clients to make
                  the best decision for them. Honesty, detail orientation, concern, compassion and professionalism have
                  instead been her trademark. I do not believe I know a more grounded realtor, or human being, than
                  Jeannie Brooks. </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>Small towns, such as Ridgefield, are rife with gossip and back stabbing. Instead of engaging in these
                  hurtful activities, Jeannie has instead gone in the direction of caring about people, animals and the
                  community at large. Being a good wife and attentive mother, since having become both, have been her
                  passion and life‚Äôs work. The results are obvious. </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>I am proud to know that Jeannie considers me to be a friend. I cannot imagine having a finer person
                  as a friend.</p>

                <p>Kathy, I‚Äôm so sorry to hear of Jeannie‚Äôs passing and so appreciate you reaching out to friend me
                  recently. Jeannie will forever bring a smile to my lips and make me laugh out loud. She was SO FUNNY
                  and we shared a common sense of humor that really was special and made for some wonderful memories.
                  Seriously I think I cried laughing w/ Jeannie more than any other person I‚Äôve ever known. I‚Äôve got
                  (bittersweet) tears in my eyes right now remembering some of the silly and hilarious things we‚Äôd do
                  together. </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>I remember other more mundane things, as well, like how she hated tuna fish unless it was absolutely
                  PULVERIZED. And when she showed me the oh so clever technique of combining vanilla ice cream
                  with...wait for it...OREOS!! ü§™ And when we traveled to Rosemont to visit you...and tour the campus of
                  course ... and never saw the inside of a classroom but did meet some guy named Ted (a total babe!)
                  whose picture i kept and lied to everyone in my freshman year of college that he was my BF! I could go
                  on and on and on. </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>I last reached out to Jeannie on FB a few years ago, just to say hey I think when your Dad passed(?),
                  but sadly that‚Äôs about all the contact we‚Äôve had since HS. What a pity and no one‚Äôs fault but what a
                  pity given how much joy she gave me during some kinda very tough years (HS really sucks in so many
                  ways...). </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>And YOU, my dear. I just told my husband - God‚Äôs honest truth - that I think of you nearly EVERY TIME
                  I FOLD LAUNDRY because for some reason I remember that you liked to fold the family laundry. I have an
                  indelible image in my head of you in your tv room off the kitchen folding laundry and not letting or
                  wanting anyone else to help. Funny the things you remember. </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>I have a sister named Jean, who I‚Äôm very close to. Sisters are better than gold. I‚Äôm certain she
                  remembers Jeannie (and some people used to call Jean ‚ÄúJeannie,‚Äù which had the effect of injecting your
                  awesome sister in my thoughts at totally random moments). Again, it‚Äôs the laughs that Jean will
                  remember of the times she was with Jeannie and me - Jeannie and I were actually quite funny when we
                  got together. It is my sincerest wish for you that when you think of your beloved sister, you will
                  hear the same laugh that I will always remember, and that that will simply and forever bring you the
                  same pure joy and laughter her memory brings to me. And that it hugs your heart ‚ù§Ô∏è. </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>Xoxo </p>

                <p>I am sipping a cup of tea in memory of dear Jeanne as I write this note. I am so grateful that Jeanne
                  was a part of my life and my families when both our families were young and growing up. I enjoyed many
                  cups of tea (and wine!) with Jeanne in the day and it was always just a bit more soothing and special
                  at the Brook‚Äôs home because of the great company. </p>
                <p>I met Jeanne when our babies were young. She really was the brightest, kindest and most down to earth
                  person I met when first coming to the area. She was wicked funny and smart, which I loved, and of
                  course, Dave and I loved Randall too and it was just always the best time when we were with the
                  Brooks. Jeanne and I discovered the things we shared when it came to growing up in New York, being a
                  part of a big Irish family and all the joys, stories, rules and memories that came with that.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>Jeanne was a wonderful friend and confidante. She was always so supportive. I will never forget how
                  when we talked about our children, our families and friends, she was always a patient listener, ready
                  with a wise word, thought and surely a good joke thrown in for good measure and she always let me in
                  on the best advice she got in her beloved parenting group that I could never get to. Those normal,
                  uneventful days, around the kitchen counter, feeding the kids and talking were the best. </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>There were so many memories and fun times. From the days in Newcomer‚Äôs going to all the family and
                  couple events, holiday parties at the Brooks, Family Halloween Parties at the Parks, girlfriend
                  birthday lunches, Holiday Strolls, being privileged to share in many extended family gatherings and
                  especially the long, lazy summers days at PVRA pool club, swim meets and hanging out with our kids and
                  sharing those days together. </p>
                <p></p>
                <p> One particularly great memory was a Jimmy Buffet Concert road trip where we christened the Park‚Äôs
                  new mini-van with Jeanne, Randall and Aunt Kathy, decorating the car and doing our best to keep up
                  with all the parrot heads during a great tailgate and concert in Great Woods, MA. Those were the days!
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>Dear Randall, Kayla and Madeline, please know that myself, Dave, Thomas, Sean and Elizabeth have you
                  in our thoughts and prayers and we will never forget sweet Jeanne. She was the best of the best...May
                  she rest in eternal peace and joy. </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>‚ÄúMay the Road Rise up to meet you, May the wind be always at your back, May the sunshine warm upon
                  your face, May the rain fall soft upon your fields and until we meet again, May God hold you in the
                  palm of His hand‚Äù - An Irish Blessing </p>

                <p>Jeannie and I met through Newcomers in 1995-1996ish. These were the days of play groups, parades on
                  Main Street, bunco, parties and a fun cast of characters. She was kind, generous, beautiful and she
                  loved to giggle. A lot! </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>We all had so much fun at Jeannie and Randall‚Äôs, especially at the infamous tattoo party. Great food,
                  cheer and music...that was the norm at 14 Loren Lane. There were endless summer days at the
                  pool...swim meets, the kids running around, snacks and drinks under the tree with Jeannie and her
                  mom...I‚Äôll never forget Jeannie and I standing together at a swim meet when another mom approached us
                  and asked if I was pregnant, which of course I wasn‚Äôt! Jeannie and I laughed about that together for
                  the rest of the summer, as she tried to convince me that I didn‚Äôt look like I was expecting...it was
                  just a long few months of snacks and drinks at the pool, ha ha! </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>When the kids got a little older, Jeannie quietly took me out to look at houses in Ridgefield. I
                  think we both knew, deep down, that Dave and I would never actually buy any of the homes she showed
                  me, but we sure had such fun looking and giggling...and dodging people we knew along the way. </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>Randall, Madeline and Kayla...Dave, Will, Charlie and I send our deepest condolences to you. Jeannie
                  always had her priorities in order and had so much love in her heart as a phenomenal wife and mother.
                  Her love for you and pride in you was immeasurable. Jeannie and I had a secret perfume back in the
                  day-I will always wear it and it will remind me of her and endless summertime. And we will never
                  forget the good old days. God bless you all and god bless Jeannie in heaven. Love, Heather B. </p>

                <p>Dear sweet Jeannie,</p>
                <p>You were always so gracious when we saw you on holidays and birthdays at Eve and Ed&#39;s. When I
                  think of you, I think of a lovely welcoming smile and fun easy conversation. You were a great support
                  at one time in particular when I wasn&#39;t sure I would make it through the toddler years. You said,
                  &#34;It gets better&#34; at one of the gatherings. (It did!) Those three simple words really helped
                  me.</p>

                <p>We all need a friend who will pick us up when we are going through difficult times. Jeannie was that
                  friend to me. Her wisdom, strength, and compassion have gotten me through dark times. I valued her
                  intellect and called on her often to help me with challenging decisions. She was a fighter, and I
                  relied on her strength when I didn‚Äôt have any. I believe many of us, if given the diagnosis she was
                  given, would have been too afraid to move on from it, but she quickly realized, ‚ÄúIf you want to lift
                  up yourself, lift someone else up.‚Äù I am going to miss you, my dear friend.</p>

                <p>Dear Jeannie,</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>We are so grateful to John and Kathy because, among other things, almost 18 years ago they introduced
                  us to you and Randall at their wedding rehearsal dinner. Joan and I were immediately struck by the
                  genuine kindness and warmth from you and Randall. As then, so it is now. Every time we have been
                  together since, especially when the ‚Äúkids‚Äù are included, that same feeling of love and warmth is
                  rekindled. Together, we have watched our children grow to amazing young men and women, each and every
                  one. It makes me so happy when one reaches out to another.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>Love always,</p>

                <p>This photo was from one of your visits to California. We all were all so happy on Outward Bound,

                  take more selfies and gather more stories. I know that one day we will be together again, and we will
                  paint together on the beach with a warm cup of tea.</p>

                <p>Hi Jeannie - Just wanted to let you and your family know that you are such a dear friend. You are so
                  special and are loved by all of us!!! We have shared so many wonderful memories and momentous events
                  together from all our 40 years of friendship. Just to name a few: Holy Child prom &amp; graduation,
                  Rosemont, bridal showers, weddings, baby showers, birthday gatherings in NYC, dinner parties and
                  sharing many stories about our kids! I value our friendship; you are so thoughtful, always listening,
                  providing encouraging sentiments and cheering us up when going through challenging times. </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>I&#39;m sending along just a couple of pictures from some of our funnier dinner parties at
                  Coeli&#39;s (don&#39;t recall why we were in the trunk of a car but I think it had to do with jelly
                  shots), your house (we uncovered Coeli keeps laughing cow cheese in her purse to snack on) and my
                  house (tiki torch fire).</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>I&#39;m thinking of you everyday and sending you my love and prayers. Please give Jeannie a big hug
                  for me!!! XXOO Sharon</p>

                <p>Dear Jeannie, Randall, Kayla and Madeline,</p>
                <p></p>
                <p> I have so many fond memories of holiday dinners and family gatherings...one in particular comes to
                  mind...the whole Colloton/Brooks family was beginning Christmas dinner, seated at your beautifully
                  festive dining room table..after saying blessings, Eve and Ed shared the news that Eve was
                  pregnant!.... a round of congratulations and much happiness and joy.., and then I got to share my
                  secret, that I was pregnant as well!! A double whammy good news !!....as it turns out, it wasn&#39;t
                  really that much of a secret that evening, a least not to Jeannie, because she later told me that she
                  had a pretty good hunch I was pregnant, because when we arrived at your house, and was offered a beer
                  or something to eat, I immediately declined the alcohol but was STARVING! I guess that was enough to
                  tip you off, Jeannie :)</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>It was a wonderful holiday, as were so many that we shared!</p>
                <p></p>
                <p> Then we lost touch....divorce can do that...I missed seeing you all....it wasn&#39;t until
                  Tese&#39;s funeral that I saw you all again....when I arrived to attend the service, I was greeted
                  with profound joy and love by Kath and Jeannie, it was heartwarming to see that they missed me as much
                  as I missed them:&gt;</p>
                <p></p>
                <p> I&#39;m so grateful that we reconnected!! </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>....Which reminds me of another story, one that always comes to mind whenever I think about Jeannie
                  and the girls...</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>...before everything was so digitally connected....</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>Jeannie was very pregnant with twins, and had to be monitored regularly...thanks to &#34;modern
                  technology&#34;, it could be done over the phone,,,not a cordless phone or cell phone, but a
                  &#34;real&#34; phone, that had the round mouth piece so Jeannie could attach a device that sent the
                  girls heartbeats to the doctor by holding the phone to her very large belly...its not a funny or silly
                  story, it just a very distinct memory I have of you, Jeannie, so big and uncomfortable, yet still so
                  sweet and friendly, struggling to sit down on the LOW couch, next to the phone that was attached with
                  a cord, that sat on the end table in Tese&#39;s living room in Larchmont... so many years ago...we
                  have all been through a lot since then...thank you for all your support, love and friendship along the
                  way.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>Sorry I don&#39;t have any pictures to send this time...I&#39;ll see what I can dig up..they are
                  literally buried under boxes, behind spare bed, next to stored drums, in the corner of my room.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p> You are always in my thoughts and much love to you all.</p>

                <p>Thinking about how much fun we had this afternoon! We attended the coolest off-Broadway play a few
                  years ago, with just 30 audience members in the basement of a church. We were full of laughs and
                  cheers during the play, and during intermission you were brave enough to run onto the set to take a
                  quick picture and had me join you :) I will always think of you and your love for spontaneous fun </p>

                <p>This picture will always remind me of a perfect summer evening. We ate endless summer fare (Ed‚Äôs mint
                  potato salad!), laughed, and enjoyed everyone‚Äôs company as the water lapped below the deck and the sun
                  set with a stunning array of colors. Kath gave all the girls tie dye sweatshirts to round out the
                  evening. I will miss you, Jeannie, at these gatherings and in the pictures with the girls but somehow
                  I know you will be there with us.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>I will think of you when I have a cup of English Breakfast tea and when in a cozy setting - you have
                  a gift for sharing the best of both. I will think of you on brilliant summer days and when I walk on
                  the beach. And I will think of you when confronted with a parenting challenge or celebrating the good
                  times. I will miss your kind and supportive calls or texts just when I need them. </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>Sitting at our table in California during one of your visits, we all wrote down what we would like to
                  have more of in our lives. You said you would like to laugh more. I hope your wish came true. You
                  seemed to laugh often and with ease. You deserved so much laughter and lightness as you navigated this
                  tricky disease with your ever-present grace and strength. </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>Several years ago, you gave us a candle holder with the words on it, ‚ÄúCollect Moments, not Things‚Äù.
                  That was classic you - the thoughtful gift as well as the message. It has sat on a shelf ever since.
                  It is lit now and we are holding you close.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>I am grateful for all you have brought to my life, Jeannie. I hope you are at ease knowing you are
                  surrounded by your beautiful, loving family - Randall, Madeline, and Kayla who we will love and
                  support always. May you rest well now. I imagine Tese will be waiting for you with a warm cup of tea.

                  complete awe every time in how you navigated the traffic and people throughout the city.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>I often think back to the many times sitting in your house talking, cooking, &amp; most importantly
                  drinking tea. I always lover your display of Nanny‚Äôs hats &amp; trying them all on. I still have the
                  black &amp; white one you gave me years ago. </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>I am so thankful, I got to reunite &amp; see you a couple years ago. It makes me so happy to think of

                  cherish our friendship. I still remember meeting you for the first time in the parking lot of
                  Ridgebury Elementary School. It was on our girls first day of kindergarten. We laughed and looked at
                  each other and said, ‚Äúnow what?‚Äù</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>Since that day, you have been a constant, supportive presence in my life and I am so very grateful
                  for you. There is no one else I know who can write such an eloquent thank you note. I have such
                  wonderful memories of sailing to Block Island with all the kids, steaming crabs at my house, sharing a
                  cup of tea in your beautiful home full of the smell of homemade Christmas cookies, meeting in town for
                  dinner dates with Gregg and Randall.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>You are an inspiration Jeannie‚Ä¶your strength, courage, grace and faith are unbreakable my sweet
                  friend. You have enriched my life with your kindness and love. It is by far one of the greatest gifts,

                <p>I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôve ever thanked you for holding my hands all of Thanksgiving Day 1984 and teaching
                  me how to walk. My mom has said that you sacrificed nearly the entire holiday and I‚Äôm grateful as it
                  is a skill I use almost daily. </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>I know that that you are going into hospice tomorrow and I am praying that you are all wrapped in a
                  peace that surpasses all understanding. I also pray that when more difficult emotions come in waves,
                  you can all hand them to a powerful God who is more than capable to help you with them all. We should
                  all say, more liberally, if and when someone has touched our life and I genuinely can think of only a
                  handful of people who have been as much of an example of grace and love. </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>In a family event of 50+ people, you were often one of the few who took the time and effort to
                  genuinely check in, even when I was just one of a dozen kids running around. Please know how
                  significant your presence has been in my life and I‚Äôm sure many many others. Thank you for the legacy
                  of grace and love‚Ä¶.and the walking thing!</p>

                <p>Jeannie my sister, my best friend. We grew up side-by-side sharing a room until I moved home from
                  college. Jeannie was the messy one, so we divided the room in half and I won the closet and she won
                  the doll house. We made it from Norwalk to Larchmont, through stints with her hair‚Ä¶Aunt Mary cut it
                  and I permed and she never recovered, through a million games of boxball and babysitting the
                  neighbors, to surviving my teaching school in the basement and her 16th surprise party (she was
                  furious with me), to being caught by mom in our room with friends and wine under her bed, to moving up
                  and out and becoming best dressed and as neat as can be.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>Then came Alison, and Randall and Jeannie and the high school prom. Rosemont and her best friends for
                  life, a move to Baltimore to attend a better business school‚Ä¶but it was really to be with Randall ‚Äì my
                  parents gave a blind eye as long as it was in Baltimore, to surviving two months on and two month off
                  to be covered in love each and every time Randall returned. Sailing with Randall parents, water
                  balloons flying at Harborfest and crabs in Baltimore and soon to be up east, a move back north and a
                  tough conversation with my parents, followed by Greenwich, a marriage proposal on my York Avenue
                  balcony and dinner at Lion‚Äôs Rock, engagement pictures on the beach in Westhampton, a fabulous wedding
                  and the greatest relationship and love of all time with Randall. Ridgefield soon beckoned.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>Later a phone call ‚Ä¶Randall and I can‚Äôt come to visit you in London as we are pregnant with twins ‚Äì
                  hooray! Jeannie confined to the couch watching I Love Lucy DVDs and laughing and laughing ‚Äì maybe that
                  is where the girls got their love of laughter. Kayla and Madeline arrived bathed in love and in the
                  kitchen sink. A million car trips from Darien to Ridgefield, Ed rocking the girls, and me telling
                  Jeannie their diapers are too small they are growing up. Then came the parenting group and her forever
                  friends, led by Margie, they are still best friends for life. It took the girls more than a decade to
                  discover who they were. She went from mentee to mentor and now she is the coach. Jeannie found her
                  life‚Äôs purpose to coach others and she has made a difference in so many lives especially mine.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>Some great things come to mind: dancing in the Brooks family room after Christmas dinner, both of us
                  loving spaghetti Bolognese, Jeannie scouring NYC for the best restaurants for ‚Äúcore four‚Äù dinners, our
                  trip to Florence and Italy for the girls graduation, church giggles with Mama, white stew with Uncle
                  Jimmy, cheese platters for every occasion and no occasion at all, Big East dinners, Jeannie‚Äôs getting
                  dressed each and every day in fashionable outfits and jewelry‚Ä¶.she is the best dressed cancer patient,
                  beautiful flowers in the Brooks house, her sailing excursions with Randall, her patience with the
                  family animals the bunnies, the hermit crabs and now wonderful Nellie and Rosie, her ability to sit
                  through 5 hours of ballet rehearsals and recitals three times in a row times so many years, giggles
                  with Mama at Monty Python, hundreds of hours filled with love and my mother at Fox Hill and Ridgefield
                  Crossings and fashion shows and wreath fests at Founders Hall, her real estate stories, and Jeannie
                  and Randall sailing and laughing and smiling and sailing some more and Jeannie‚Äôs tea, tea and more
                  tea.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>Jeannie‚Äôs capacity for love is something we all admire most. She convinced my mother to move to
                  Ridgefield in 2000 to help care for Kayla and Madeline as they were entering kindergarten and to join
                  her in real estate, but in reality, it was Jeannie who wanted to care for my mother. And care she did.
                  She almost gave her life to ensure my mother was well cared for, but she set an example for us that no
                  love is too great. It got much easier when we graduated from college and somehow went from terrible
                  teens to both being best friends with my mom. So much shopping, and laughing and always finding a
                  restaurant for lunch, no matter the shop. I will never forget when Jeannie discovered her new found
                  thrift store finds were previously worn clothes.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>Jeannie accepted John into our lives as soon as I introduced him and you made him feel loved and very
                  much an integral part of this family. He immediately won the girls over with the starbucks candy
                  canes, that‚Äôs for sure.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>Our life has been filled with extended family and vacations and always the beach. I just found out
                  your favorite perfume is called the beach ‚Äì how fabulous is that. We have the greatest memories of
                  summers spent in rentals in Southampton with 4 mothers, 19 kids and 4 kids to a bed and fathers on
                  weekends. Lots of love and games with the cousins and fascination with just what exactly the older
                  cousins were doing. This was soon followed by our own many times in Westhampton and Naples. First with
                  mom and then without. So much love, so many memories.</p>

                <p>I am not sure why it took until we turned 50 to start doing solo sister trips, but it was Aunt
                  Catherine and Ed and Eve that finally gave us a reason to travel on our own just the two of us. What
                  special memories. In 2016 we flew to Ashville to see Aunt Catherine and keep the important McLoughlin
                  family and sister connection alive. Year one having no idea where we were going we ended up in a
                  terrifying flea bag motel where all we could muster was beers at a local bar and biscuits for
                  breakfast, year 2 we found the trendy Windsor hotel in downtown Ashville and the Strada restaurant but
                  mostly we found lots of love with Aunt Catherine and decorated her room with family pictures and
                  shared St Patricks day decorations with her whole community ‚Äì she adored it. Year 3 we discovered the
                  Biltmore Estates courtesy of my new travel discount, we had made it, we filled ourselves with
                  McLoughlin love and off we went back north. </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>In 2017 we headed west for a California visit with Ed, Reed, Greta, and Autumn, we so missed Eve who
                  had to head East to help with her family. What a special Columbus Day weekend that was. They toured us
                  around Mill Valley, showed us Mount Tom, introduced us to Stinson Beach and Terie came for a visit. We
                  were filled with family love and off we headed back east. </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>One of the things we all admire most is Jeannie‚Äôs fight and determination to stay healthy‚Ä¶ and she
                  did just that, surviving as part of only 5% of patients who made it past two years much less the 7
                  years she is currently working on. From the onset of her 2013 diagnosis, she and Randall did
                  everything imaginable to stay alive. She fought the health battle and Randall fought the research and
                  the doctors battle and they won. It looked so effortless as she gave up sugar and carbs and started a
                  healthy eating and exercise routine. The girls barely knew she was undergoing chemo and radiation as
                  they prepared to graduate high school, again she made it look effortless. Always the fighter and
                  always the victor. Off she flew to Paris and Italy for the girls graduation trip taking her chemo on
                  the flight, she wasn‚Äôt going to give in. All these years and all the help and advice she gave
                  countless glio patients and their families, even trying so hard to work for Joe Biden and sons Beau
                  Biden foundation. Jeannie never gave in. </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>These last few weeks have been wonderful and the saddest of my life. Jeannie is still fighting to be
                  with her adoring husband of 40 years. They have the most admired marriage and his loving care and
                  attention now are exactly what has made Jeannie thrive these last 40 years. The couple that could not
                  move ‚Äútwo steps‚Äù without each other in the 1980‚Äôs are still now two steps from each other lying side
                  by side in the Ridgefield sunroom. Their love for each other has radiated from the very start and as
                  someone else said they truly hit Lotto with their love.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>What I smile about most is these two beautiful loving daughters Madeline and Kayla that Jeannie and
                  Randall have raised. They manifest Jeannie and Randall in every wonderful way. You were tough and they
                  are better for it, just like Mom was to us. They love to laugh and dress beautifully, and to share
                  some cheese and some wine. They share your love of cooking, they are smart and successful, they hug
                  you so tight, as the core four are so tight. Jeannie you can be so proud. I love that Margaret and
                  Alex and Kayla and Madeline have each other. You and Alison will someday dance and laugh together
                  watching these girls and their families grow up. </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>Jeannie as you sail off into fairer and I am certain warmer waters, be calm, be at peace, keep that
                  grace you have always had. For soon, Randall, Kayla, Madeline, myself and all of us will join you for
                  forever sunsets, cheese and crackers, wine, and lots of Jeannie love. Part Two</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>All my forever love, Kath</p>
                <p></p>

                <p>When I think about Jeannie her strength in dealing with adversity comes to mind. Watching Jeannie
                  battle cancer was truly extraordinary. Her determination to beat it provides a role model for all of
                  us and it was matched by her discipline in fighting it. Her success was due factors that go beyond the
                  drug trial. It was her discipline in sticking to a diet that made her forego numerous foods that most
                  of us take for granted. It was discipline in sticking to an exercise regime that helped her manage the
                  side effects of the drug trial, chemo, etc. It was her positive attitude that enabled her to face
                  adversity without flinching. Most of all, it was her faith in her savior because she was willing to
                  place herself in his care and not question why she was stricken but, how can she fulfill the Lord‚Äôs
                  wishes. She did it by being a role model in confronting her illness with dignity and without
                  self-pity. Crisis strips us to the core and reveals the true person and cancer revealed the inner
                  Jeannie. </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>A Good Person describes Jeannie perfectly. The phrase describes the whole of the person. A good
                  person understands and knows their self. A good person not only knows the difference between right and
                  wrong but, uses it as a baseline for conducting their life. A good person does the right thing because
                  they are guided by their better angel and consequently, does not worry about the outcome. Most of all,
                  a good person understands what to value in life and never ceases to lose sight of it during the circle
                  of life. That is Jeannie Brooks. </p>

                <p>Dear Jeannie,</p>
                <p>Here is a selection of some of the fun times we have all shared going back to the 80&#39;s, what a
                  trip! How lucky was I to make friends with Kath and then get another great friend in you-what a deal!
                </p>
                <p>Will never forget that crazy boat trip marking the centennial celebration of the Statue of
                  Liberty-baking in the summer sun all day, waiting for the nighttime fireworks.</p>
                <p>How spoiled were we sailing around the Carribean in a J-51 sailboat with a captain and chef! Nothing
                  was too good for our crew ;)</p>
                <p>Found some pics of your shower &amp; lovely wedding; the first time I introduced Jean at an official
                  event, he still remembers it well.</p>
                <p>Then you and Kath at our wedding almost 30 years ago. And finally Luc, Kayla and Madeline at the duck
                  pond. I was trying to find the adorable photo at our house in East Hampton of the three of them
                  sitting on the front porch in their pj&#39;s- I&#39;ll keep looking.</p>
                <p>While living abroad for so long we didn&#39;t see all of you as much but we always managed to keep
                  our friendship going, it was still so special when we did. I remember missing you more when I did see
                  you since it brought back all the closeness we had shared in the past. That&#39;s what makes
                  friendships that go way back so amazing.</p>
                <p>I am blessed to have such an incredible friend in my life, you are a model of strength, courage and
                  dignity but especially of what love means. </p>
                <p>Jean, Luc and I hold you tightly and close to our hearts- we love you dear Jeannie. </p>
                <p></p>
                <p></p>
                <p>Hey Jeannie,</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>I just wanted you to know that though we are far away we keep you very close to our hearts and always
                  will. Knowing you were there for me and taking the time to write when I was going through a terrible
                  time in my life gave me a lot of strength to see it through- it is always wonderful to know we are
                  loved. I will keep you in my thoughts; sending prayers of support and strength to you, the girls, Aunt
                  Kathy and Randall. I have many special moments I can look back at and treasure, you guys were always
                  our extended US family and I hope you know you still are.</p>

              <div class="card-text my-2 p-2 text-dark">
                <p>The old neighborhood (11 Ellsworth Road) where it all began for me.</p>
                <p>It was the new house in the suburbs after living in the &#34;woods&#34; of Norwalk where your Mom was
                  born.</p>
                <p>Memories:</p>
                <p>The dogs. We had a lot of them. There was the one that ate every single one of Momma&#39;s new
                  kitchen cabinets when we were away. There was murphy, who attached himself to Drew Rover&#39;s behind.
                  Then there was Fonzi, Momma&#39;s favorite. </p>
                <p>There was the neighbor across from our driveway who took any ball that went into their yard. One
                  mischief night, we set upon his car to exact years of revenge. We deflated his tires, soaped the
                  windows, covered the car in shaving cream, and put a bumper sticker on the back that said &#34;look
                  out America, we are out to change your diaper&#34;. He left the car there for a week. Momma struggled
                  mightily to not let on that she thought it was hysterical. Years later, she told us that she never let
                  on to him that she knew who did it - and she loved it!</p>
                <p>Boxball on Ellsworth with the entire neighborhood.</p>
                <p>Biking to the duck pond (watch out for low branches!)</p>
                <p>skating at the duck pond</p>
                <p>When the brook flooded and we all walked home from school in the rapids. Remember how high it got on
                  Brookside Drive and the raging falls?</p>
                <p>Hiding in the clubhouse under the stairs while mom showed the house to buyers.</p>
                <p>The crib your younger brother Andrew had with the locking lid. He was never kept/babysat in there was
                  he? lololol</p>

                <p>Kathy included that you may want a prayer. I‚Äôm sure Jeannie knows The Chaplet of Divine Mercy and
                  would probably be grateful to hear it prayed for her. If you don‚Äôt know it, it‚Äôs quite easy,
                  repetitive and said on the rosary to keep track, please google it and say it for your Mom. I will also
                  be saying it for her‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
                <p>I‚Äôve known and loved your mom ever since I met your Aunt Kathy in college. She is tremendously sweet
                  and supportive, always fun! She was always in NYC for Big East with us and her string bean casserole
                  will never be forgotten, not for what you all think but because your aunt and I thought it was
                  hilarious! </p>
                <p>When Jeannie found out she was having twins I believe I gave her our crib and was petrified that
                  meant I‚Äôd get pregnant again! You all had a nice trip to Spring Lake when you were babies that I‚Äôll
                  always remember, somewhere there are pictures of my kids holding Kayla and Madeline. Fast forward to
                  the wonderful 60th she planned for Kath and how beautiful she was that night, she pulled off a
                  wonderful surprise for her best friend, 2 sisters were never closer. Jeannie, I love you, Anmer‚ù§Ô∏è</p>

                <p>Then the beers were a quarter, who&#39;d a thunk</p>
                <p>Then came the Jeannie that took a chance</p>
                <p>On to the table in a Larchmont dance</p>
                <p>And all the cadets looked on in awe</p>
                <p>Must be the twin of the girl they first saw</p>
                <p>A gent from the South</p>
                <p>With suds round his mouth</p>
                <p>Mostly quiet as lamb</p>
                <p>That man</p>
                <p>Said, &#34;howdy ma&#39;am&#34;</p>
                <p>My name&#39;s Randall, will you be my waff</p>
                <p>Some &#39;un like you, I&#39;d like in my life</p>
                <p>Jeannie saw those eyes of blue</p>
                <p>and said, &#34;I will, I will, I do, I do&#34;</p>
                <p>She fell for his charms</p>
                <p>Literally into his arms</p>
                <p>She wanted more</p>
                <p>And moved to Baltimore</p>
                <p>Randall wanted a child</p>
                <p>Jeannie wanted more</p>
                <p>And she got her way</p>
                <p>When she picked up that stray</p>

                <p>They&#39;d a been gone long ago</p>
                <p>But they come by often of late</p>
                <p>To have their mom tell them they&#39;re great</p>
                <p>&#39;Cause she&#39;s a mother that&#39;s fine</p>
                <p>they&#39;d say, &#39;most of the time&#39;</p>
                <p>She&#39;s raised them both well</p>
                <p>Like the true southern belle</p>
                <p>Poised and with grace</p>
                <p>Well dressed and good taste</p>
                <p>They carry their mother&#39;s values with them</p>
                <p>And they&#39;ll pass those on to their children</p>

                <p>Jeannie was going to ODU at the time and Randall&#39;s car was vandalized at the school. It went to a
                  local repair shop on 21st street (I can&#39;t recall the name of the shop). It has been there for
                  weeks and they had been giving Jeannie the run around on a regular basis. I recall taking her by there
                  to check on the progress and your mom lit the owner up. She used all of her New York chutzpah to give
                  him holy hell. I just stood by in amazement and watched her go at him. The car was repaired not too
                  long after that episode. </p>

                <p>So it took me years to know Madeleine from Kayla, probably 5 to ten years. I finally do know. Of
                  course my first memorable instance, and favorite one, was at Halloween, when both of you asked for
                  something from my visit to Salem, Ma. Well, I brought things back for you and then I got my present -
                  the sweetest thank you cards, from each of you. One thanked me for making the house look ‚Äúcreepey.‚Äù
                  The other one was sweet too. I spent time today looking for them, but not luck. I‚Äôll never forget
                  though. </p>
                <p>Well, after that there were many occasions when a little nothing was rewarded with more lovely thank
                  yous. So where do thoughtful and admirable gestures like that come from? Well, obviously they come
                  from decent warm wonderful people. Randall and Jeannie. </p>
                <p>So now when I think of the Brooks‚Äô I think of two friends, two wonderful parents to smart, gorgeous
                  girls, two people who opened their doors to me as family and two people that run off to Paris once in
                  a while, or God knows where else, to be together. I miss seeing you. Greg</p>

                <p> saw the call go out for pics and stories‚Ä¶ here‚Äôs what I could find and put together quickly:</p>
                <p>For me, it all began when the band I was in - The Bad, Bad Blues Band ‚Äì played the Circle K parties
                  at the Maritime College bar (which Patrick organized as Circle K prez). Patrick‚Äôs cousin Jeannie kept
                  showing up at all the parties with a bunch of her friends, and she became one of the ‚Äúhonorary
                  Maritime party-people.‚Äù I remember her having a huge smile on her face whenever I saw her - looking
                  like she was having the time of her life. Her beautiful energy beamed, and she created an amazing vibe
                  being around her. I loved it when she and her friends came to Maritime. It meant we were having a
                  great time!</p>
                <p>After college, I got the distinct honor of hosting Randall &amp; Jeannie‚Äôs Bachelor / Bachelorette
                  part at our house in Annapolis. I had never heard of having the two parties together, but they
                  insisted that they‚Äôd rather have one big party together rather than do them separately, so we
                  definitely obliged them. It was 3 days and nights of fun, music, and who knows what else at our house
                  in Bay Ridge Annapolis. The place was rockin‚Äô the whole time. Trust me, a good time was had by all!!!
                </p>
                <p>I was also honored to be in Randall &amp; Jeannie‚Äôs wedding, though Uncle Maurie didn‚Äôt really
                  appreciate catching Patrick and I putting plastic ants and a rubber mouse in the wedding cake. I do
                  believe I made mention of uncle Maurie in the wedding video (which I vehemently deny to this day ‚Ä¶ I
                  was framed I tell ya‚Äô‚Ä¶ it was someone else who looked like me and just happened to be wearing the same
                  tux as the rest of the wedding party‚Ä¶ go figure‚Ä¶ what‚Äôre the odds of that?!?!). Great wedding. I even
                  got to play wipe-out on drums with the wedding band. I did pass out in my car for a short time during
                  the reception though‚Ä¶ just when they were taking pictures of all the Maritime guys‚Ä¶ so Randall cut my
                  face out of another picture and pasted it onto the group photo when he sent me a copy of the wedding
                  pics‚Ä¶ it was nice to be included (though his ‚Äúphotoshop‚Äù skills left a lot to be desired J). </p>
                <p>Shortly afterward, Randall and Jeannie moved to Baltimore for a couple years. It was awesome! We
                  lived in Annapolis and were just a 20 minute drive from them, and so we hung out together all the
                  time. We had some of the best times ever. The 4 of us watched the 1986 super-bowl at R&amp;J‚Äôs
                  apartment when the Chicago Bears did the Superbowl Shuffle all over the New England Patriots. So many
                  great times‚Ä¶ It was sad when they moved north. The end of an era (though we did come up and visit them
                  in CT a few times afterwards).</p>
                <p>A few years later, it was our turn to get married. We had a very small wedding ceremony at our home
                  in Annapolis with just a few of our closest friends and family. Of course, Randall &amp; Jeannie were
                  a part of that. They stayed at our house ‚Äì they arrived quite late the night before the wedding, yet
                  the ‚Äúlate-night party‚Äù began as soon as they arrived. I believe Randall &amp; I and my dad also tapped
                  the first keg of beer at around 11am the next morning while the ladies were getting dressed‚Ä¶ a little
                  pre-ceremony celebration. During our wedding ceremony, we asked everyone to share what marriage meant
                  to them. I remember Randall &amp; Jeannie giving very heart-felt and thoughtful replies (unlike my new
                  mother-in-law who simply instructed me to ‚Äújust put the damn toilet seat down and everything will work
                  out fine.‚Äù Such a wise lady). After the ceremony, we had a huge party with all kinds of bands and
                  hundreds of people (we had published an open invitation to our wedding party in our monthly music
                  magazine ‚Ä¶ so, in a sense, we had sent out 10,000 invitations to our wedding party‚Ä¶ and it felt like
                  everyone showed up!) At the end of the night, the house was a complete disaster area. Diana &amp; I
                  slipped away to go on our ‚Äúhoneymoon‚Äù (a night in a local hotel which I believe Randall &amp; Jeannie
                  helped arrange). When we came back home the next day, the house was spotless. Randall &amp; Jeannie
                  and a few others had stayed up and cleaned the entire place ‚Äì it was a miracle. That was the absolute
                  best wedding gift ever! </p>
                <p>In sum, Randall &amp; Jeannie have been a part of the fabric of my entire adult life. Though we don‚Äôt
                  see each other much any more, there‚Äôs never been a doubt in my mind that if either of us needed
                  anything, we would be there for each other no matter what. I hope they both know that will always be
                  so. </p>
                <p>Thank you for all the years of friendship and laughter. I love you both more than you can imagine‚Ä¶.
                </p>
                <p>Big Hugs to You Both,</p>

              <div class="card-text my-2 p-2 text-dark">
                <p>We used to live in Parkland, Florida. Our triplets entered 6th grade and I knew we needed to leave
                  for better education. I was given the name of pair of realtors. The conversations between us were less
                  than satisfactory. Almost condescending. I told the man that I was flying up alone to look at houses
                  and would he mind if my friends in NY came along? He actually minded so much that he said that I
                  should find myself another realtor!‚Äô </p>
                <p>I was at once rethinking my desire to relocate. Apart from the schools, we had an excellent life. But
                  my mom‚Äôs best friend‚Äôs daughter, Michele Fugazy, who lived in Ridgefield, contacted me and told me I
                  had the wrong realtor and that I absolutely needed to contact the most wonderful realtor immediately.
                  Her name is Jeannie Brooks. </p>
                <p>I called her at once. What a breath of fresh air she was!! I told her I was coming up that weekend
                  and would she mind if my friends came along? ‚ÄòAbsolutely‚Äô she said, ‚Äòin fact its even better that
                  way!‚Äô </p>
                <p>So I flew up to NY and we joined my friends: Erika, Eileen, And Marybeth. They all bonded instantly.
                  My friends had hilarious comments about every house we went into, including, ‚Äòoh look at these
                  countertops, midgets must have lived here!‚Äô and, when descending to a very smelly basement, ‚Äòsomeone
                  certainly has a shoe fetish!‚Äô The best was, ‚Äòcool, so when cooking dinner you can also do your
                  laundry!‚Äô But nothing they said curbed Jeannie‚Äôs enthusiasm.</p>
                <p>After seeing 5 houses in my price range, I was very frustrated. They all had significant issues. But
                  Jeannie was undaunted. We talked on the phone that evening and I expressed my dismay at the houses we
                  saw and said that maybe this was not meant to be. She told me, and I will never forget this, that
                  Ridgefield needed people like me and we should keep trying. Which of course we did! And to fruition!!!
                </p>
                <p>That was nearly 12 years ago and Jeannie has been my best friend in Ridgefield ever since. We walked,
                  we dined we met for tea, and we never ran out of things to say. I would not have moved here but for
                  her. And I have enjoyed every moment. She has shared all of my everything. I love her.</p>

                <p>There are too many to count but some that are etched into my head forever:</p>
                <p>1) I don‚Äôt have any pictures - but I know there are a lot to back me up somewhere‚Ä¶.I just remember
                  being in AWE of Jeannie when she was in High School/College‚Ä¶I would be at your house on Hazel Lane
                  (hiding from my mother, no doubt) and you would breeze in &amp; out with your long hair and, your
                  sunglasses on your head like a headband, a fair isle sweater in the latest color combination and car
                  keys jingling in your hand. You would be headed out somewhere and I would be so jealous - I thought
                  your life was SO glamourous!! </p>
                <p>2) Fox Hall / Gin Lane / Southampton. You and Anne Nowicki had your own language / world /
                  relationship that Mary Ann &amp; I were dying to be a part of. You had your little ‚Äúmouse dolls‚Äù that
                  had names &amp; outfits, you had your full Eunice &amp; Momma schtick that would send us all into fits
                  of laughter. I also have vivid memories of us all dancing to the Beatles in the living room.</p>
                <p>3) Our Christmas Eves together are very high on my list of cherished memories. You and Randall never
                  failed to show up with the most amazing appetizers - always a highlight (especially for the Rote
                  children). You would outdo yourselves each year. I could have sat around that table with all of you
                  for hours and hours ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶if only I didn‚Äôt have to unearth &amp; wrap all of the hidden xmas gifts once
                  the evening was over! xxoo Nadine</p>

                <p>Hello Jeannie,</p>
                <p>I am thinking of the more recent times we met at RJ Julia Booksellers in Madison &amp; caught up with
                  each other while perusing their wonderful selection. We‚Äôve had many, many great conversations over the
                  years, sometimes with months &amp; months in between. We always fell into each other‚Äôs lives so
                  easily. I am very grateful for that. It‚Äôs a gift to be able to share things easily with someone you
                  don‚Äôt see or talk to often. I will treasure our talks. But, of course, I also remember all the summers
                  we spent together, playing all day at the beach or jumping in the pool. We had an easy friendship
                  Jeannie. I will always smile at that. I love you. God bless you. Love, Anne</p>

                <p>Dearest Jeannie ‚Äì I dream of our being together right now, sharing stories and catching up over a cup
                  of tea. Our recent visits, whether in Ridgefield or New Canaan, are each a special, happy memory. I
                  always looked forward to them. I want one more. Thank you for reaching out to set them up, or
                  responding right away when I‚Äôd suggest a date. Somehow being together melted away long stretches of
                  time when we wouldn‚Äôt see each other. We‚Äôd catch up over each of the kids, wrestle with at least one
                  in a tricky or unsettled spot, then move on to Alex and Randall. Always there were memories of growing
                  up, talk of siblings and how they were doing - Ed most recently being the furthest afield and living a
                  life far away from our Connecticut routine. There was always summer to discuss ‚Äì either recapping the
                  highlights at the beach ‚Äì Westhampton or Nantucket ‚Äì or describing the one upcoming, glorious in our
                  anticipation. There was invariably the mention of that exceptional Southampton summer on Gin Lane.
                  That really was a seminal moment for our McLoughlin clan. How young we were - Good heavens! I know
                  you‚Äôre surrounded by family, loved beyond measure and feeling peaceful inside with your deep faith and
                  unmatched grace. You can count on the wise counsel you always gave others to guide you now. Those of
                  us writing hold you close and treasure you as much as ever. We are there fully in spirit and share
                  your lovely company in our hearts. Take good care, rest for now, and let‚Äôs visit for tea again as soon
                  as we can. With all my love ‚Äì Christine ‚ù§</p>

                <p>Jeannie,</p>
                <p>I chose this picture to share with you today because I can remember it like it was yesterday. Both
                  you and Kath helped me to organize a lunch for your mom and aunt Catherine (and we threw in Joe‚Äôs side
                  too...Not sure why lol) at any rate, I remember thinking ‚Äúwhat do I make, buy, and serve to this
                  group?? Both you and Kath said ‚Äú Mom and Aunt Katherine LOVE quiche‚Äù!!! So I thought ‚Äúhmmm who makes
                  the best quiche for these two quiche connoisseurs??‚Äù So I ran to St. Moritz in Greenwich and bought a
                  few, made a salad and served a ton of coffee. We all enjoyed one another so much that day. It meant a
                  lot to me to have you over and I know Michael felt the same way. Clearly by the ages of Charlotte and
                  Claudia in this picture, we were still in the thick of the daily grind of raising little ones, but you
                  were a few years ahead of me and Kayla and Madeline were more independent. Hence the reason they
                  didn‚Äôt join. So wish they had... and Randall too!!</p>
                <p>Of all the cousins that I inherited by marriage you and Kath stole my heart! You have always been
                  lurking in the side lines if I needed some really good solid parenting advice! I knew you took your
                  job of parenting your two lovies pretty damn seriously! It‚Äôs evidence you were and still are a top
                  notch Mom! One who deserved a pay check!! Your girls have turned out so incredibly well. They are
                  smart, ambitious, loving and funny young women. You did good Jeannie!! </p>
                <p>Which brings me to the time you and my brother Mark worked on ‚Äúyour reinvention‚Äù of yourself and your
                  career. I love that you had the ambition to try again! To recreate! To think outside of the box! Mark
                  enjoyed working with you throughout the entire process.</p>
                <p>You have taught me probably more than you realize..</p>
                <p>the obvious lesson.. parenting is tough but never stop working at it because the results come and
                  it‚Äôs worth every exhausting moment!</p>
                <p>But what you may not realize is that you taught me to fight hard in life! That although life will
                  throw hard balls, you get up each and every day and persevere. You have never given up on yourself and
                  that is quite a lesson! One that I am certain not only I will forever carry with me but many others
                  who have known you!</p>
                <p>I adore your wonderful family and I thank you for allowing me to be a part of your lives. I love you
                  Jeannie.</p>
                <p>Rest peacefully!</p>
                <p>Xoxo</p>

                <p>I still remember freshman year we had all arrived, ‚Äúwet behind the ears‚Äù, trying to find our place.
                  We lived in the dorm Kaul on the second floor with Sharon, Coeli and I think I met Jeannie because
                  Sharon knew her from home. It was kinda comical because Jeannie‚Äôs roommate was this ‚Äústone pony‚Äù girl
                  from N√©e Jersey named Esther. She was definitely a bit rough around the edges and I am not sure if she
                  stayed at Rosemont past freshman year. I can‚Äôt remember what year it was that your mom left Rosemont,
                  (I so secretly was always envious that she has the strength to leave), and kinda lost touch for a few
                  years. This is the amazing part!! It had been quite a few years before I saw your mom and dad, but
                  when I did it was fore life! I could talk to Jeannie for hours and hours, loving her sense of humor
                  and perspective, but mostly her quiet manor. She loved to laugh and we always found something to laugh
                  about. Jeannie always made me want to be like her, be a better person when I was with her and
                  afterwards. I would love when I would get the call that you all were coming out and could we get
                  together, even for a fast cup of coffee. Your mom, and dad, both always made me feel so special, so
                  loved when I was in their presence. I sit here today, and can only smile (and cry a little) at the
                  thought of a world without Jeannie. But, I realized we won‚Äôt be without Jeannie, she is just in
                  another room. I believe you will send us little signs from above to let us know that you are still
                  with us all. It never mattered how long between out visits, because the moment we would be together it
                  was as though no time had passed. It will be that way again someday. I lost my mom when she was 54 and
                  I know how hard this all is, I will be here forever, waiting to see you when ever you want or need. In
                  the profound words of Winnie the Pooh, If there is ever a time when we cannot be together, remember
                  that you are braver than you believe, stronger than you seem and smarter than you think. And know that
                  your mom (and dad) have given you the most incredible gifts to continue on with life, to love life
                  like your mom always did. Jeannie will be so missed but I know that I will see her again someday and
                  it will be as though no time had passed. </p>

                <p>Hi Jeannie (and Randall, Kayla and Maddie). I attached some of my Thanksgiving pictures that bring
                  back too many good memories to even count (see photo Album for others). As the pictures will attest,
                  Jeannie always had a smile on her face and only nice things to say. Don&#39;t tell the others, but
                  you&#39;re my favorite Colloton! You&#39;re in our thoughts and prayers. We love you!!</p>

                <p>Jeannie- does this sum up the good days, or what? Well, maybe a little white wine or champagne and a
                  few nibbles.. but only YOUR creations.. crab cakes, scallops w/bacon, the perfect salad, crusty bread
                  and cheese? It isn‚Äôt just catching up at Christmas that I cherished with you..those summer days on the
                  beach, giving your mom and all the aunts heart attacks as we swam the big surf, and drove them to
                  cocktail hour with our ‚Äúfresh‚Äù sass. Employment at the NYAC? Priceless. Time with you has always been
                  the gift that keeps on giving. Every sip of tea I toast you and all you‚Äôve done in your life, hurdles
                  be damned. And always too humble. Keeping the wheels turning, the girls and Randall, your parents and
                  siblings, always your top priority with energy and love to spare for all who needed it. And you always
                  know exactly when. Sweet dreams always. Peace in your gigantic heart and quick mind always and, above
                  all, know that it‚Äôs your turn to rest and to be taken care of - no, spoiled - as no one deserves it
                  more. Smothering you, Madeline and Kayla, and Randall with love and prayers. Kath, Ed and Andrew as
                  much. Picturing you with your mother and father, with Alison, with father Peter and knowing with all
                  my heart that you will be adored always as you are every second with us. Thank you forever and ever,
                  Jeannie. I love you. - Mary Ann</p>

                  gathered at the Lilly&#39;s for a relaxing, fun evening, and it was just that. Nothing especially
