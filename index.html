        <p>Jeannie Brooks, 57, of Ridgefield, CT passed away peacefully, surrounded by her family, on February 5, 2021.
          She died from glioblastoma after being first diagnosed in 2013, and she was called home to God after a courageous battle against a reoccurrence that was diagnosed in March 2020.
          Jeannie was a beloved wife, mother, sister, and friend.
          She is survived by her loving husband of 32 years, Randall, and her two daughters who were her greatest joy in life, Kayla and Madeline, as well as her beloved siblings and their spouses,
          Katharine (John) Komar, Ed (Eve) Colloton, and Andrew Colloton. She was predeceased by her brother, Christopher Colloton, and her parents, Theresa and J. Edmund Colloton.
          <br>
          <br>
          Jeannie was born on December 3, 1963, in Norwalk, CT and she spent her early years in Larchmont, NY with her sister Kathy and her two brothers, Ed and Andrew.
          When she was in high school, she met the love of her life, Randall, and they began dating shortly after meeting. Jeannie graduated from Holy Child in 1981 and went to Rosemont College.
          After her sophomore year at Rosemont, she decided to transfer to a school that had a formal business program (and that was closer to Randall) and she transferred to Old Dominion University in Virginia,
          where she and Randall fell deeply in love. After graduating from Old Dominion in 1985, Jeannie moved to New York and spent a year at Lazard Freres as an investment advisor, honing her passion and skills for business.
          She and Randall became engaged in New York and soon after moved to Greenwich, Connecticut to start their lives as a family.
          <br>
          <br>
          Jeannie and Randall were married in 1988 at Saint Agnes Church in Greenwich, and their wedding was a true celebration of love. Jeannie then got a job at Fortune Brands in Greenwich as a financial analyst, where she
          worked for 8 years advising companies on M&A activity, a job she truly loved. Jeannie and Randall moved to Ridgefield in 1991 and Jeannie became a real estate agent in 1998, so she would have more time to raise her twin daughters.
          She worked at William Pitt in Ridgefield for 20 years and formed some of her most valued friendships with both her colleagues and her clients. Jeannie dedicated most of her time to raising the girls, and she parented with compassion,
          thoughtfulness, kindness, and wisdom. Kayla and Madeline brought her so much pride and joy, and she viewed raising her daughters as her life’s greatest accomplishment.
          <br>
          <br>
          Jeannie found joy in bringing happiness to others and she accomplished this in many ways, whether through the perfect holiday appetizer, finding the home of someone’s dreams, inspiring others through her life coaching to embrace their passions,
          or simply by expressing her love for her family and friends. We are so grateful to have had her in our lives, and her warmth for others is a gift that we will cherish always.
          <br>
          <br>
          As a family, we take comfort in knowing that she is in a beautiful place, waiting for us with a warm cup of tea.
